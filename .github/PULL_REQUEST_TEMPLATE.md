### If this is a Decidim upgrade

- [] If copied new migrations from Decidim with `bin/rails decidim:upgrade`
- [] I've ran these migrations with `bin/rails db:migrate`
- [] I've ran the tests with `bundle exec rspec`
- [] I've checked the custom fields continue to work as expected
- [] I've checked the census integration in staging
- [] I've checked the newsletter preferences are kept after the migrations
- [] I've sent a test newsletter in staging environment
- [] I've done general browsing both in front and backoffice, and created a test proposal
